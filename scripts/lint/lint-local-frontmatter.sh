# SPADE Framework — local-mode artefact schema lint (M-1023 AC#1 + AC#2)
#
# Enforces the Scope frontmatter schema and lightly checks Plan
# frontmatter for SPADE local-mode artefacts under .spade/.
#
#   .spade/scopes/*.md  — HARD-fails on an invalid status/type/priority
#                         enum value or a missing core required field
#                         (name, title, status, type, created, updated).
#                         WARNS (never fails) on an unknown field and on
#                         a missing `id` field — the v1.8 addition is
#                         grandfathered on pre-existing files.
#   .spade/plans/*.md   — light, warn-only: the frontmatter must parse;
#                         a missing recognised field only warns.
#                         Historical Plan files (M-323/M-343/M-420 era)
#                         have genuinely inconsistent frontmatter, so
#                         this check never hard-fails them.
#
# Learning files are NOT validated here — lint-learnings.sh already
# covers .spade/learnings/*.md frontmatter.
#
# The canonical enum value sets live in docs/FRAMEWORK.md § Local layout
# and are mirrored in scripts/lint/frontmatter.py. Extending an enum
# means editing that section AND the validator together — never broaden
# the lists here to silence a real file.
#
# A planted-fixture self-test runs on every invocation so the detection
# logic cannot rot silently: the bad-enum fixture MUST hard-fail and the
# legacy (no-`id`) fixture MUST pass.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every Scope and Plan file is schema-valid; the self-test holds
#   1  a hard-fail violation, or the self-test no longer behaves.
#      (Exit 2 is reserved across the lint suite for "skip"; this lint
#      never skips, so it never exits 2 — see scripts/lint/run-all.sh.)
