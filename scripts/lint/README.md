# SPADE Lint

Fifteen small lints guard the framework's shape. CI runs them on
every PR; run them locally before pushing with:

```bash
./scripts/lint/run-all.sh
```

## What each check does

| Script                          | What it guards                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lint-skill-frontmatter.sh`     | Every `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` parses and carries `name` + `description`.                                                         |
| `lint-agents.sh`                | Every `.claude/agents/*.md` parses and carries `name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`, `persona`, `focus`. Skips cleanly if the directory is absent (pre-v1.1.0 consumers). |
| `lint-examples.sh`              | `example-scope.md` has Intent / Acceptance Criteria / Constraints sections; `example-plan.md` renders every task as a complete card (What / Done when / How / Verify / Needs+Blocks / Who) whose How opens with the locked delivery-approach vocabulary. |
| `lint-fragments.sh`             | `fragments/*.md` carry no `SPADE-FRAMEWORK-*` markers (fragments are raw content; markers are added on insertion). `.spade/version` pins a valid `spade_version=X.Y.Z`. |
| `lint-learnings.sh`             | `.spade/learnings/*.md` carry the required learning frontmatter (`title`, `area`, `tags`, `created`, `status`, `public_safe`); `area` and `status` are in-vocabulary; `created` is `YYYY-MM-DD`. Warns on active entries older than 180 days. |
| `lint-onboard-idempotency.sh`   | Re-runs `tests/onboard-idempotency.sh` — 15 assertions against the Bundle A marker-replace contract.                                |
| `lint-render-smoke.sh`          | Every fixture under `tests/fixtures/render/` renders via `spade-render` to a non-empty, standalone HTML document. Skips cleanly (exit 2) when pandoc is absent. |
| `lint-mcp-guard.sh`             | Every skill that names a Linear MCP tool carries a `## Mode Resolution` section (M-879 AC#5 — no unguarded MCP calls). A planted-violation fixture self-tests the check on every run. |
| `lint-handoff.sh`               | Exercises `bin/spade-handoff-launch` in `--dry-run` mode via `tests/handoff-launch.sh` — asserts injection-safety of the handoff prompt, the worktree-collision guard, and the documented failure exit codes. |
| `lint-local-frontmatter.sh`     | `.spade/scopes/*.md` Scope frontmatter is schema-valid — hard-fails on an invalid `status`/`type`/`priority` enum value or a missing core required field; warns (never fails) on an unknown field or a missing `id` (grandfathered, v1.8). `.spade/plans/*.md` gets a light, warn-only parse check. A planted bad-enum / legacy fixture pair self-tests the check on every run. |
| `lint-skill-authoring.sh`       | Canonical skill inventories, behavioral mutation controls, generated host tokens, size budgets, helper counts, and version claims remain aligned. |
| `lint-projection-drift.sh`      | Semantic drift seeds are rejected and every generated host projection remains derived from canonical source. |
| `lint-codex-plugin.sh`          | Repo-local and installable Codex plugin manifests, marketplaces, and inventories are valid. |
| `lint-install-projections.sh`   | Bash and PowerShell global installers consume exact SHA-256 manifests, remain idempotent, remove stale owned files, and reject unsafe destinations. |
| `lint-lifecycle.sh`             | Capability authority, discrete migrations, immutable release-derived fixtures, resume and rollback, diagnostics, projection integrity, and unsupported states satisfy the lifecycle contract. |

## Dependencies

- `bash` (3.2+, macOS-friendly)
- `python3` (3.11+; only used by `frontmatter.py`, stdlib only — no
  `requirements.txt`, by design)
- `awk`, `grep`, `diff` (POSIX; any modern shell has these)

No npm, no pip install, no external YAML libraries. If a future check
needs more than flat-key frontmatter, simplify the schema or accept
PyYAML — but update `ANTI-PATTERNS.md` first.

## Running a single check

```bash
./scripts/lint/lint-skill-frontmatter.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-agents.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-examples.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-fragments.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-learnings.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-onboard-idempotency.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-mcp-guard.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-handoff.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-local-frontmatter.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-render-smoke.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-skill-authoring.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-projection-drift.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-codex-plugin.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-install-projections.sh
./scripts/lint/lint-lifecycle.sh
```

Each script exits 0 on success and non-zero with a clear failure line on
error. `run-all.sh` is a thin wrapper that runs all ten and aggregates
exit status.

## Adding a new check

1. Drop a `lint-<name>.sh` in this directory.
2. Make it executable (`chmod +x`).
3. Add it to the `scripts` array in `run-all.sh`.
4. Add a matching job in `.github/workflows/lint.yml`.
5. Document it in the table above.

Keep each lint small and focused. A lint that covers two orthogonal
concerns is two lints.
