name: spade-research
description: Landscape research on a topic via an isolated opus subagent with read-only research tools. Use when the human says "properly research this", "look into X", "check the prior art", "second opinion on the landscape", "what does the SOTA look like for X", or asks an open question that needs external fact-finding such as libraries, frameworks, benchmarks, postmortems, or comparisons. Returns a structured findings report and optionally posts to a Linear parent issue with explicit human consent. Callable at any time and not tied to a SPADE phase. Also matches the explicit slash-command form `/spade-research`.

## Update Check

Before doing anything else, run `~/.spade/bin/spade-update-check` using Bash.
Show the output to the user if it is non-empty.
If the script does not exist or fails, skip silently and continue with the skill.

## Project Config

Read `.spade/config` in the current project directory **only if you intend
to write to Linear** (i.e. the human consents in the consent prompt
below). The skill works fine without `.spade/config` — research output is
useful with or without a tracker. If the file doesn't exist and the human
later wants to attach the report to Linear, ask which team and project,
or suggest running `/spade-onboard` first.

# SPADE Research

You are dispatching landscape research to an isolated subagent and
presenting its report to the human. The skill itself is **a thin
coordinator** — the actual research happens inside a fresh
`spade-researcher` subagent context (opus, read-only tools,
defined by the bundled `spade-researcher` agent). The output
schema is documented in `docs/FRAMEWORK.md#research`.

This skill is **callable any time**. It is not gated on a SPADE
phase. It does **not** create sub-issues, transition statuses, or
generate Plans. Its only state mutation is an optional Linear
comment, gated by explicit human consent.

## Invocation modes

### Standalone — no Scope context

The default. The human asks a research question; the skill spawns
the subagent, applies the `/unslop` pass to the report's prose fields
(headings, field order, identifiers, and evidence stay unchanged),
displays the structured report inline, and stops. Any Linear posting
uses that same passed report.
Nothing is written to Linear. Examples:

- *"Could you properly research how prompt-caching is configured in
  the Anthropic SDK?"*
- *"Look into what the SOTA is for Markdown-to-HTML rendering in Go
  CLIs."*
- *"Check the prior art on persistent learnings stores in agent
  frameworks."*

### Scoped — with `--scope <linear-id>` or implicit Scope context

When the human passes `--scope M-501` (or invokes the skill from a
session that already has a SPADE phase parent issue in context — for
example, mid-`/spade-plan` on M-501), the skill prefixes the report
with the Scope ID and offers to post the findings as a Linear
comment. Posting is **never silent and never free-form**: the skill
asks the human via `AskUserQuestion` (per the framework's "Asking
the Human" convention — see `docs/FRAMEWORK.md`) which path to take.

## How to run this conversation

1. **Identify the question.** Read what the human asked. If the ask
   is ambiguous ("research auth"), ask one short clarifying question
   in free-form prose before spawning the subagent — clarification is
   open-ended composition, not a fixed-option decision, so it stays
   free-form.

2. **Identify the Scope context.** Was `--scope <id>` passed? Is the
   current session already operating on a SPADE parent issue (e.g.
   the human is mid-`/spade-plan`)? If yes, capture the Scope ID for
   the consent prompt below. If no, this is a standalone run.

3. **Spawn the researcher through registered spade-researcher agent with the declared read-only tool allowlist.** Pass:
   - The question, verbatim.
   - The Scope ID and a brief Scope summary if scoped (so the
     subagent knows what context the report is informing).
   - Any local repo paths the subagent should be aware of, if the
     question implies "compare our X to library Y".
   - Foreground execution - you need the report before the next step.

4. **Display the report.** When the subagent returns, show the report
   inline to the human exactly as the subagent emitted it (the
   schema is locked at the framework level and consumers parse it
   positionally — do not summarise or reformat).

5. **If standalone, stop.** No Linear write, no further action.

6. **If scoped, ask the consent question via `AskUserQuestion`.**
   The question is *"This report can be posted as a comment on
   <issue-id>. Which would you like?"*. The options are exactly:

   - *Post this comment to <issue-id>*
   - *Just show me — don't post*
   - *Let me edit it first, then post*
   - *Cancel*

   Never use a free-form "y/n?" prompt. Never default to posting.
   Never proceed without an answer.

7. **Act on the consent answer.**

   - **Post this comment** — post the report to the parent issue
     verbatim, prefixed with `research:` on its own line at the top of
     the comment body so it is visually distinct from Plan comments
     (which start with `# Plan for ...`). Confirm to the human with
     the comment URL.

   - **Just show me** — do nothing. The report is already displayed
     inline; the conversation continues.

   - **Let me edit it first** — display the report in a code block
     marked `markdown` and ask the human to paste back the edited
     version. When they do, post their edited version with the
     `research:` prefix.

   - **Cancel** — drop it. No comment, no follow-up.

## Linear write — partial-failure handling

If the consent path is "post" and the Linear write fails (MCP
unreachable, parent issue resolved-mid-flight, comment write
rejected), follow the same precedent as `/spade-plan`'s Linear
Integration:

1. Surface the failure to the human exactly: which step failed, what
   error came back.
2. Display the report **back inline** (in case the human's terminal
   scroll-back lost it) so they can manually paste it elsewhere if
   they want.
3. Do **not** retry indefinitely. One retry is fine if the failure
   looks transient (e.g. proxy 503); two failures means stop.
4. Do **not** auto-create a fallback `.spade/research/<id>.md` file —
   research outputs are ephemeral by design (see
   `docs/FRAMEWORK.md#research`). If the human wants persistence,
   they can copy the report into a file themselves.

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not generate a Plan, create sub-issues, or transition any
  Linear status. Research is informational; it informs human
  judgement, but doesn't drive the SPADE loop directly.
- It does not invoke `/spade-review`. Research is fact-finding from
  outside; review is opinion on our own work. They're different.
- It does not capture findings as `/spade-learn` learnings
  automatically. If the report uncovers something worth carrying
  forward to future Plans, the human can invoke `/spade-learn`
  separately.
- It does not iterate. One question per invocation. Follow-up
  research is a follow-up invocation.

## After research

If the report changed the human's view on a Scope or Plan they're
working on, suggest the next SPADE step they might want to take:

- New finding that affects an in-flight Scope → suggest the human
  edit the Scope (`/spade-scope` on the parent issue) to incorporate
  the new constraint or option.
- New finding that affects an in-flight Plan → suggest revisiting
  the Plan (revise via `/spade-plan` if the Plan is still in
  Approval, or open a follow-up Scope if delivery has started).
- Finding worth keeping for future Scopes → suggest
  `/spade-learn` to capture it as a public-safe or private learning.

These are suggestions, not actions. The human decides what to do
with the report.
