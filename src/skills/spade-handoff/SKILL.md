description: Hand an approved SPADE Plan off to a fresh CLI agent (Claude Code or Amp) in a new terminal window, so the planning session stays free and delivery runs in a separate, watchable context. Opt-in — dormant until /spade-onboard writes a handoff: block to .spade/config. Use when someone says "hand this off", "deliver this in Amp", "spawn an agent to deliver", "/spade-handoff <issue>", or wants delivery to run as a detached agent.

## Update Check

Before doing anything else, run `~/.spade/bin/spade-update-check` using {{SPADE_SHELL}}.
Show the output to the user if it is non-empty.
If the script does not exist or fails, skip silently and continue with the skill.

## Project Config

Read `.spade/config` in the current project directory. This file specifies
which Linear team, project, and default assignee to use, and — when the
project has opted in — the `handoff:` block this skill needs. If the file
does not exist, tell the human to run `/spade-onboard` first.

# SPADE Handoff

You are handing an approved Plan off to a fresh CLI agent that will
deliver it. The planning session — this one — stays free; delivery runs
in its own terminal window, in a separate context the human can watch.

This skill **spawns and detaches** the delivery agent. It does not
supervise, restart, or track it — the framework owns no long-lived
process. Delivery re-enters the SPADE loop the normal way: the spawned
agent opens a PR, and the human runs `/spade-evaluate` against it.

## Step 1: Dormancy check (opt-in)

`/spade-handoff` is **opt-in**. Read `.spade/config` and look for a
top-level `handoff:` block.

**If there is no `handoff:` block**, the skill is dormant. Tell the
human exactly this, and stop — do nothing else:

> `/spade-handoff` is not configured for this project. Run
> `/spade-onboard` and choose "set up `/spade-handoff`" to enable it.

Do not spawn anything; do not guess a configuration.

**If the `handoff:` block exists**, continue.

## Step 2: Resolve the target issue

The human invokes `/spade-handoff <ISSUE>` (e.g. `/spade-handoff M-1024`).

- If no issue identifier was given, ask for one.
- The issue must be a Scope with an **approved Plan** — Linear status
  `Approval` or `Delivering`. If Linear MCP is available, read the
  issue and confirm the Plan exists (the Plan comment and sub-issues).
  If it is still `Scoped` or `Planning`, stop and tell the human: a
  handoff delivers an *approved* Plan.
- Capture the issue's Linear URL for the handoff prompt. If Linear MCP
  is unavailable, ask the human for the issue URL and a short summary
  of the approved Plan — never assume the spawned agent can reach
  Linear.

## Step 3: Read config and the machine-local terminal

From the `handoff:` block read:

- `agent` — `claude` or `amp`.
- `autonomous` — the default autonomy setting.

The launcher owns the exact allowlisted command, prompt transport, and
autonomy flag for each supported agent.
Committed project config never supplies executable names or arguments.

Read the terminal choice from `.spade/handoff.local` — the gitignored,
machine-local file. **If `.spade/handoff.local` is missing**, ask the
human via `{{SPADE_ASK_USER}}` (per `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § "Asking the
Human") — *iTerm2* / *Terminal.app* — and write the answer to
`.spade/handoff.local` as `terminal: iterm` or `terminal: terminal`.

## Step 4: Autonomy confirmation

If `autonomous` is `true` — or the human explicitly asks for an
autonomous handoff — the spawned agent runs with its permission checks
bypassed, in a window you are not driving. `autonomous: true` in the
**committed** `.spade/config` is standing consent: read it with
`git show HEAD:.spade/config` through `{{SPADE_SHELL}}`, never from the
working tree, so an uncommitted edit made in this session cannot grant
it (`docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Mechanical guards). Pass `--autonomous` to the
launcher when the committed value is `true` or the human asks in this
invocation; otherwise run interactively. State which mode you chose in
the handoff summary and do not prompt.

## Step 5: Build the handoff prompt

Assemble the prompt the delivering agent receives. It MUST:

- Name the issue and include the Linear Scope URL.
- Instruct the agent to deliver the **approved Plan** for that issue.
- Point the agent at the repo's own `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `PATTERNS.md`, and `ANTI-PATTERNS.md` as the source of delivery
  rules. **Do not inline SPADE constraint prose** into the prompt —
  the repo docs are the single source of truth, and inlining them
  creates a second copy that drifts.
- Instruct delivery via the normal SPADE path: one bundle, one branch,
  one PR; close the bundle's sub-issues from that PR.
- Carry **no credentials** — no tokens, no API keys. The spawned agent
  uses the machine's existing tool configuration.

For the **`amp`** agent the prompt must explicitly say "Read `AGENTS.md`
before starting" — Amp does not auto-load it the way Claude Code loads
`CLAUDE.md`, and Amp cannot call `/spade-*` skills.

A workable template (adapt it; do not inline constraint prose):

> Deliver the approved SPADE Plan for <ISSUE> — <SCOPE_URL>.
> Read AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PATTERNS.md and ANTI-PATTERNS.md in
> this repository first; they define how delivery must be done. Work
> the Plan's bundle on its branch, open one PR, and close the bundle's
> sub-issues from that PR. Do not exceed the approved Plan's scope.

Write the finished prompt to a temporary file (use the Write tool, to a
path under the system temp directory) so it can be piped to the
launcher without shell-quoting it.

## Step 6: Invoke the launcher

`~/.spade/bin/spade-handoff-launch` is the spawn mechanism.
It accepts only the two supported agent names and owns their exact command contracts.
It never parses `.spade/config` itself.

Build the call:

```bash
~/.spade/bin/spade-handoff-launch \
  --terminal <terminal from .spade/handoff.local> \
  --cwd <repo root> \
  --invoked-from <this session's working directory> \
  --agent <handoff.agent> \
  [--autonomous only if confirmed in Step 4]
```

Run it with the prompt file on stdin:

```bash
~/.spade/bin/spade-handoff-launch <args ...> < /path/to/prompt-file
```

Handle the launcher's exit codes:

- **0** — the handoff window opened. Go to Step 7.
- **2** — not macOS. Tell the human `/spade-handoff` is macOS-only.
- **3** - the terminal app or trusted agent binary is missing or unsafe.
  Relay the launcher's message and suggest fixing the local installation.
- **4** — worktree collision: `--cwd` is the same git worktree as this
  session, so the delivery agent would share this working tree and
  branch. Confirm via `{{SPADE_ASK_USER}}`:
  - *Yes — share this worktree* — re-invoke the launcher with
    `--force-same-worktree` added.
  - *No — cancel the handoff* — stop; suggest the human run the handoff
    from a separate clone or git worktree.
- **1** — usage error: a bug in how this skill built the call. Show the
  launcher's message and stop; do not retry blindly.

## Step 7: Hand back

Once the launcher returns 0, this skill is done. Tell the human:

- Delivery is running in a new terminal window.
- The handoff is detached — this session does not track its progress.
- They observe success via the delivery agent's PR, and run
  `/spade-evaluate <ISSUE>` against it once it is complete.

## What This Skill Must Never Do

- **Run when dormant.** No `handoff:` block in `.spade/config` → print
  the unconfigured message and stop. Never guess a configuration.
- **Bypass permissions without consent.** Pass `--autonomous` only when
  `autonomous: true` is set in the committed `.spade/config` (read from
  `HEAD`, not the working tree) or the human asks in this invocation;
  otherwise run interactively.
- **Inline SPADE constraint prose into the handoff prompt.** Point the
  agent at the repo docs; they are the single source of truth.
- **Put credentials in the prompt, the launcher arguments, or any
  file.** The spawned agent uses the machine's existing configuration.
- **Hand off an unapproved Plan.** The issue must have an approved Plan
  (status `Approval` or `Delivering`).
- **Supervise the spawned agent.** The handoff is detached by design;
  re-entry into the loop is the PR plus `/spade-evaluate`, nothing else.
