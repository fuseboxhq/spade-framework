# SPADE Framework — Agent Operating Rules

This file defines mandatory behaviour for all AI agents operating in this project.
These rules are non-negotiable. If you are an AI agent reading this file, you must
follow every instruction below. Violations of the SPADE loop undermine the audit
trail and the trust model that makes human-AI collaboration safe.

## The SPADE Loop

Every unit of work in this project follows five phases:

    SCOPE → PLAN → APPROVE → DELIVER → EVALUATE

Humans own Scope and Ship. AI owns Plan and Deliver. Approve and Evaluate
are gates: human on the Plan and Scope autonomy levels, machine-recorded and
human-reviewable on the Deliver level while mechanical guards are live (see
`docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Mechanical guards).
Done follows the Evaluate verdict: an agent that recorded PASS on the reviewed
head moves the issue to Done itself.
You must never skip a phase or combine phases without explicit human instruction.

**Exception — the fast-track path.** Trivial work (a typo, a one-line tweak,
a config nudge) can use `/spade-quick` instead of the full loop. See the
"Fast-Track Path (Small Work)" section below for the gate criteria. When
in doubt, use the full loop.

**Exception - governed non-shipping experiments.**
One explicitly invoked, confirmed throwaway experiment may use
`/spade-unhinged` only while every current and proposed path remains outside
the canonical `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Security-sensitive path surface.
It creates no SPADE lifecycle artefacts and is never approval to land or ship.
Retained or shared work requires an `[unhinged]` Draft PR audit, which must be
closed before the unchanged work re-enters `/spade-quick` or the full loop.

**Entry point — the `/spade` orchestrator.** New work can start with `/spade`,
which presents an autonomy picker (Deliver / Plan / Scope / Stub) and drives
the loop from one locked Scope as far as the chosen level allows, halting on a
tripwire. It does **not** change the loop or remove any gate: at the Plan level
it halts before delivery, exactly where the Approve gate sits, and it routes
trivial work to `/spade-quick`. Deliver is the recommended default
(`autonomy.default: deliver` in `.spade/config`, written by `/spade-onboard`);
the picker appears only when no default is set. See `docs/FRAMEWORK.md`
§ Autonomy Pipeline.

## Phase Rules

### 1. Scope (Human-Owned)

- You must NEVER begin planning or writing code without a written Scope, a
  valid fast-track gate pass, or an explicitly confirmed `/spade-unhinged`
  non-shipping experiment operating within its canonical path gate.
- A Scope is a parent issue (in Linear or your project tracker) with:
  - A clear statement of intent (what and why)
  - Acceptance criteria (how we know it is done)
  - Architectural constraints (tech stack, patterns, security requirements)
- If a human asks you to "just do X" without a Scope, ask them to define one first.
  Help them write it if needed, but do not proceed to Plan without a documented Scope.
- When the brief already carries the intent, draft the whole Scope yourself and
  ask one confirm (lock or edit) rather than interviewing field by field
  (`docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § "Nailed"). The bar is unchanged; the turn count is not.
- Scopes may originate from OKRs, milestones, or reactive work (tickets, incidents).
  The origin does not matter. The clarity of intent does.
- **Horizon-bound repos** (a `horizon:` block in `.spade/config`): every Scope
  maps to exactly one Linear Milestone — the 1:1 anchor for a Horizon roadmap
  Item. `/spade-scope` prompts for it (warn, not block); Plan task sub-issues
  stay unmilestoned so the rollup counts roadmap Scopes, not tasks. Never
  create a Milestone — that is a human-owned roadmap decision. See
  `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Horizon Roadmap Binding.
- **Before writing a Scope, check the fast-track gate.** If every criterion
  in "Fast-Track Path (Small Work)" below passes, invoke `/spade-quick`
  instead of `/spade-scope`. The full loop is for work that deserves the
  ceremony; trivial changes deserve speed.

### Prose quality

Apply the `/unslop` pass to every human-facing output before presenting or persisting it, in every phase.
Machine-read artefacts (code, config, JSON envelopes) are exempt; the `/unslop` skill is the single source for what the pass removes and adds.

### 2. Plan (AI-Owned)

- When a Scope exists, you produce a structured Plan before writing any code.
- The Plan must include:
  - 3-7 discrete tasks, each completable in a focused session
  - A technical approach summary and risk callouts (assumptions,
    unknowns, things that might go wrong)
  - One strict card per task - **What / Done when / How / Verify /
    Needs / Blocks / Who** - covering the change, its observable
    outcome, the delivery approach, verification, dependencies in both
    directions, and delivery mode plus effort
  - A groundwork note (in **What**) for every intentionally horizontal
    or preparatory task, naming the vertical task it enables
  - Delivery bundles: how tasks map to pull requests. Default is one bundle
    (one PR) per Scope. Only split into multiple bundles when tasks are
    genuinely independent — no shared files or symbols, no dependency arrows,
    and isolated review or revert provides real value (e.g. a risky migration
    separated from related feature code, or docs-only work separated from code).
- The Plan is a first-class artefact. You must:
  - Document it as a comment or attached document on the parent issue
  - Create sub-issues for each task with appropriate labels
  - Apply labels: `ai-planned`, and either `ai-delivered` or `human-delivery` per task
- You must NOT begin delivery until the Plan is approved: by a human on the
  Plan level, or by the machine-attributed auto-approval the Deliver level
  records (§ Approve).
- If using Linear via MCP, create sub-issues on the parent issue automatically.
  Set status on the parent issue to "Planning" while generating the plan.

### 3. Approve (Human Gate)

- After producing a Plan, you must STOP and wait for human approval.
- **Deliver-level exception:** the Deliver autonomy level (`/spade`) records a machine-attributed auto-approval and continues to an open PR, project-native checks, and the two-axis Delivery Review.
  With mechanical guards live and `autonomy.deliver.merge: on-green`, it then records the Evaluate verdict and merges when the verdict is PASS, checks are green, and the reviewed head is unchanged; the guard enforces those conditions.
  Under the default `human` policy, or when guards are not live, it halts before merge and the human operates the merge.
  Every other path keeps this pre-code STOP gate.
- Present the Plan clearly and ask the human to review it against:
  - Architecture alignment (does this fit established patterns?)
  - Completeness (are there obvious gaps?)
  - Feasibility (can this actually be built this way?)
  - Risk (are assumptions valid?)
  - Scope (is the task breakdown at the right granularity?)
- If the human rejects the Plan or requests changes:
  - Apply the `plan-rejected` label to the parent issue
  - Revise the Plan based on their specific feedback
  - Present the revised Plan for approval again
  - Do not begin delivery on a rejected plan
- If the human approves, update the parent issue status to "Delivering".
- A fast approval is acceptable for low-risk, granular tasks.
  A thorough review is mandatory for tasks touching architecture, security,
  or cross-system boundaries.
- **Independent second opinion (optional).** Before deciding, the human may
  request a review via `/spade-review`. A triage step casts persona subagents
  for the change — drawing on five canonical personas (scope-guardian,
  architecture-strategist, security-lens, adversarial-reviewer,
  alternatives-analyst) and inventing ad-hoc personas where a risk dimension
  has no canonical lane, under drop-with-cause (canonical personas are
  defaults; dropping one is recorded; the cast never falls below three) —
  then spawns them in parallel where the runtime supports it. Each returns
  structured findings; the coordinating skill merges them by convergence and
  presents a tiered report. Non-blocking: the review never gates approval or
  delivery.

### 4. Deliver (AI or Human)

- Execute tasks from the approved Plan one **delivery bundle** at a time.
  A bundle is a single branch and a single pull request that closes one or
  more sub-issues. The approved Plan defines which tasks belong to which
  bundle. The default is one bundle per Scope.
- For each bundle:
  - Create one branch for the whole bundle
  - Work through the sub-issues in dependency order, committing as you go
  - Open a single PR that closes every sub-issue in the bundle
    (e.g. `Closes M-68-1, Closes M-68-2`)
  - Do not open additional PRs for sub-issues inside the same bundle
- For each AI-delivered task within a bundle:
  - Read the sub-issue context before starting
  - Write code, tests, configuration, or documentation as specified
  - Run tests and verify they pass before marking the sub-issue complete
  - Update the sub-issue status to "Done" when complete
  - Apply the `ai-delivered` label if not already present
- For human-delivered tasks:
  - Leave the task clearly described with all necessary context
  - Do not attempt work that requires organisational context, physical access,
    stakeholder relationships, or decisions you cannot make
- If you encounter a problem during delivery that invalidates the Plan:
  - Stop delivering
  - Explain what went wrong
  - Suggest whether a Plan revision or Scope revision is needed
  - Wait for human guidance before continuing

### 5. Evaluate (Human-Owned Outcome, Agent-Recorded When Fully Verifiable)

- After all sub-issues are complete, the output is evaluated against the
  original Scope's acceptance criteria.
- The agent records the PASS, PARTIAL, or FAIL verdict when every criterion is diff-verifiable or runtime-verifiable with fresh evidence on the reviewed head, and moves the issue to "Done" on a PASS.
  Any external-state or human-only criterion, or any open row, leaves the verdict to the human.
  A PARTIAL or FAIL verdict, or any open row, leaves the issue in "Evaluating" with the evidence gaps surfaced.
  Done is the audit-trail closure point, so it is only ever reached with a recorded PASS behind it.
- If asked to help with evaluation, you may:
  - Run the acceptance criteria as checks and report results
  - Highlight areas where output may not fully meet the Scope
  - Suggest additional verification steps
- A full-loop evaluation records an acceptance-evidence matrix with exactly one
  row per criterion, classified as `diff-verifiable`, `runtime-verifiable`,
  `external-state`, or `human-only`.
- Runtime and UI evidence must be fresh for the final reviewed head and must
  name the command or project-native tool plus its result.
  UI evidence is required only for a criterion with a UI surface.
- External-state and human-only rows remain explicitly open until authoritative
  evidence or human confirmation exists.
- Findings from the independent Scope-conformance and engineering-standards
  delivery-review axes feed the existing PASS, PARTIAL, or FAIL verdict without
  adding a phase or transferring the final decision from the human.
- If evaluation fails:
  - Minor issues: work goes back to Deliver with specific fix instructions
  - Fundamental issues: work goes back to Plan for a revised approach
- Merge follows `autonomy.deliver.merge` in `.spade/config`: `human` (the default) means the human operates the merge; `on-green` lets the agent merge once Evaluate recorded PASS on the current head, required checks are green, and the merge command is pinned to that head.
  On the Claude host the guard hook enforces the policy and denies every agent merge under `human`; where guards are not live, the human may still explicitly ask the agent to merge once checks are green.
- **Capture learnings.** After Evaluate, or anytime during delivery when the
  team notices something worth carrying forward, suggest `/spade-learn` to
  record it under `.spade/learnings/`. `/spade-plan` surfaces matching prior
  learnings automatically when a related Scope comes through next time, so
  each pass of the loop strengthens the next.

## Mechanical Guards

On the Claude host, SPADE ships command hooks driven by `bin/spade-guard` that
enforce the invariants the harness can check without judgement: no protected-path
edit while `/spade-quick`, `/spade-unhinged`, or a Deliver run is active, the
merge policy, and (opt-in) no stage-everything `git add`. A guard deny is a halt: surface the
reason to the human and wait. Do not remove a marker, edit the guard or
`.spade/config`, or reach the same file through a shell command. Guards are
inert outside a repository with `.spade/config`. When
`.spade/guard/<session_id>/live` is absent the guards are not live and the
previous model applies: the full fourteen-category pre-code halt and human
merge. `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Mechanical guards is the single definition.

## Architecture Constraints

Before generating any Plan, you must read the following files if they exist in this
repository. These define the architectural boundaries you must operate within:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system architecture, infrastructure, and data flow
- `PATTERNS.md` — approved patterns, libraries, and conventions
- `ANTI-PATTERNS.md` — things you must not do, with rationale

If a proposed solution conflicts with these documents, you must flag the conflict
in the Plan and get explicit human approval before proceeding.

## Linear Integration

When Linear MCP is available, you must use it to:

- Read Scope from parent issues (including acceptance criteria and constraints)
- Create sub-issues for the Plan with descriptions, labels, and priorities
- Update issue statuses as work progresses through SPADE phases
- Attach Plan documents as comments on the parent issue
- Apply labels consistently: `ai-planned`, `ai-delivered`, `human-delivery`,
  `plan-rejected`, `needs-arch-review`

Parent issue statuses map to SPADE phases:

| Status      | SPADE Phase |
|-------------|-------------|
| Scoped      | S           |
| Planning    | P           |
| Approval    | A           |
| Delivering  | D           |
| Evaluating  | E           |
| Done        | ✓           |

Sub-issues use a simpler workflow: Todo → In Progress → Done.

## Audit Trail

Every durable or delivered repository change must use a recognised audit
shape: the full-loop five-link chain, the quick-path PR artefact, or an
`[unhinged]` Draft PR for a retained or shared non-shipping experiment.

The full-loop chain is:

1. A human-written Scope (the "what")
2. An AI-generated Plan (the "how"), documented on the issue
3. An Approval decision (the "approved by")
4. Delivery records (the "done"), with labels showing who delivered each task
5. An Evaluation (the "verified"), done by a human

On the quick path, the completed PR description is the audit artefact and no
sub-issues or separate Plan are created.

The Unhinged Draft records the experiment intent, entry briefing, protected-path
checks, complete changed-path inventory, verification, and the exact statement
`not approved for merge`.
It is evidence of experimentation, not Scope, Plan, Approval, Evaluate, merge
authorisation, Done, or Ship.
The skill never merges or marks the draft ready.
Retaining the work requires closing the Draft PR, verifying its authoritative
closed state, and re-entering `/spade-quick` or the full SPADE loop with the
unchanged work.
The human continues to own Ship, and Evaluate and Done follow the recorded verdict.

You must never deliver work that cannot be traced through its recognised audit
shape.
This is not optional. The audit trail is the mechanism by which AI-delivered
work remains trustworthy.

## Fast-Track Path (Small Work)

Not every change deserves a Scope. The fast-track path handles trivial work
— typo fixes, one-line tweaks, small config nudges, docs changes — through
`/spade-quick`. On this path, the **PR description is the audit artefact**:
no sub-issues, no separate Plan, no approval gate beyond PR review.

**When a human describes a small fix, tweak, config nudge, or docs change,
check the fast-track gate BEFORE invoking `/spade-scope`.** If every
criterion below passes, run `/spade-quick`. Only fall back to the full
loop if the gate fails.

### The Gate — ALL must be true

1. Single concern (one bug, one tweak, one touch-up)
2. ≤ 50 lines of code changed total; hard stop above ~100
3. One file, or a tight cluster in one module
4. No new dependencies (package.json / go.mod / pyproject / Cargo.toml untouched)
5. No schema, migration, or data-layer changes
6. No architectural changes, no new patterns, no new abstractions
7. No security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, secrets, permissions)
8. No public API or interface breaking changes
9. Reversible as one commit
10. Existing tests cover the area (trivial extension is fine; new test
    scaffolding is not)

If *any* criterion fails, stop and invoke `/spade-scope` for the full loop.
The gate is all-or-nothing — do not attempt to "partially" fast-track.

### Linear tracking on the fast-track

- Parent issue gets labels: `spade:quick`, one `type:*` label
  (`type:bug`, `type:tweak`, `type:chore`, `type:docs`, `type:refactor`),
  and `ai-delivered` or `human-delivery`.
- **No sub-issues are created.** The parent issue IS the work unit.
- The PR description is the audit trail. PR URL is posted as a comment on
  the parent issue. Close it once the PR is merged with its checks green;
  that merged PR is the quick path's audit artefact.

### Incident response

Incidents and larger reactive work do NOT use the fast-track path. Ceremony
is cheap during an incident — use the full loop so the audit trail is
complete.

### Evaluating quick-path work

`/spade-evaluate` on a `spade:quick`-labelled issue validates the PR
directly (merged, CI green, checklist complete) instead of iterating
sub-issues. If evaluation is PARTIAL: fixes go as new commits on the
same branch if the PR hasn't merged, or as a new quick-path PR referencing
the original if it has. **Sub-issue creation is forbidden on the quick
path regardless of verdict.**

## What You Must Never Do

- Begin writing code without a documented Scope, a valid fast-track gate pass,
  or an explicitly confirmed non-shipping `/spade-unhinged` experiment inside
  its canonical path gate
- Begin delivery without an approved Plan (on the full loop)
- Move a parent issue to Done without a recorded Evaluate verdict of PASS behind it
- Skip the Plan documentation step (plans are artefacts, not ephemeral)
- Misuse `/spade-quick` for work that fails any gate criterion
- Create sub-issues on the fast-track path
- Merge, mark ready, or treat an `[unhinged]` Draft PR as shipping approval
- Disarm, edit, or route around a mechanical guard; a guard deny is a halt to
  surface (`docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Mechanical guards)
- Introduce technologies or patterns that conflict with ARCHITECTURE.md
  without flagging the conflict and getting explicit approval
- Assume organisational context you do not have (ask the human)
- Combine multiple Scopes into one delivery without human agreement
