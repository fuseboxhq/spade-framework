description: Fast-track path for trivial work — tiny bug fixes, one-line tweaks, config nudges, docs typos, and other changes too small for the full SPADE loop. Use when someone says "just fix this small thing", "quick tweak", "one-line change", "typo fix", "rename this variable", or when you would otherwise invoke /spade-scope for a change that clearly meets every gate criterion below. Do NOT use for anything touching architecture, auth, schemas, public APIs, or requiring more than one focused commit.
---

## Update Check

Before doing anything else, run `~/.spade/bin/spade-update-check` using exec_command.
Show the output to the user if it is non-empty.
If the script does not exist or fails, skip silently and continue with the skill.

## Project Config

Read `.spade/config` in the current project directory. This file specifies
which Linear team, project, and default assignee to use. Use these values
for all Linear operations. If the file doesn't exist, ask the human which
team and project to use, or suggest running `/spade-onboard` first.

## Mode Resolution

Before any tracker call or local-file access, resolve the operating mode
**once** per `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Mode Resolver:

- Read `mode:` from `.spade/config`. An explicit value (`linear`,
  `local`, or `hybrid`) wins immediately.
- If `mode:` is absent, auto-detect: probe with a `list_teams` MCP call
  (try/skip, 5-second timeout). Resolve `linear` if it returns a team
  set containing `linear.team_id`; otherwise resolve `local`.
- Failure policy: an explicit `mode` with a configured `team_id` and a
  failing probe is a **fail-loud abort**; an absent `mode` with a
  failing probe **degrades quietly to `local`**.

Do not embed the resolver algorithm — it is single-sourced in
FRAMEWORK.md. The resolved mode governs every tracker-vs-local branch in
this skill:

- **`linear`** — the tracker is canonical; operate against Linear MCP.
- **`local`** — `.spade/` files are canonical; make **zero Linear MCP
  calls**; read and write the paths in FRAMEWORK.md § Local Layout.
- **`hybrid`** — the tracker is canonical; after a successful tracker
  write, mirror to `.spade/` best-effort per FRAMEWORK.md § Hybrid Mode.

# SPADE Quick — Fast-Track Path for Small Work

You are delivering a trivial change through the SPADE fast-track path.
The full loop (Scope → Plan → Approve → Deliver → Evaluate) is friction
theatre for a typo fix or a one-line config tweak. `/spade-quick` compresses
it into four steps — **Identify → Fix → Verify → PR** — where the PR
description is the audit artefact and there are no sub-issues.

This path is a privilege, not a default. If *any* gate criterion below
fails, stop and run `/spade-scope` for the full loop instead. The gate
exists so fast-track does not slowly swallow the framework.

## Conversational Style

Fast-track should feel fast but not reckless.

1. **Walk the gate out loud, then decide.** Do not silently decide the
   work is trivial: state each criterion and its result. An ambiguous
   criterion is a failed criterion; fall back to the full loop rather
   than asking the human to call it.
2. **Be willing to bail.** If anything feels bigger than it first looked
   (scope creep mid-fix, an unexpected test failure exposing a deeper
   issue), stop and recommend falling back to `/spade-scope`. The cost
   of restarting is low; the cost of a fast-track change that should
   have had a Scope is high.
3. **Classify yourself.** Pick the closest `type:*` label and say which
   in the PR; do not ask.
4. **Do not monologue.** One sentence per step update is enough.

## The Gate — ALL must be true

Walk through each of these before writing any code. If any one fails,
stop and invoke `/spade-scope` instead.

1. **Single concern.** One bug, one tweak, one touch-up. Not "fix bug
   and also clean up a bit while I'm there."
2. **≤ 50 lines of code changed total.** Soft cap. Hard stop above ~100.
   If you're not sure, bail.
3. **One file, or one tight cluster in one module.** Not spread across
   unrelated files.
4. **No new dependencies.** `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`,
   `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, and equivalents must remain untouched.
5. **No schema or migration changes.** No touching database schemas,
   migration files, data-layer models, or anything that would require
   a data backfill.
6. **No architectural changes.** No new patterns, no new abstractions,
   no moving code between layers, no new top-level directories.
7. **No security-sensitive code.** No auth, crypto, secrets handling,
   session management, permission checks, or input validation on a
   trust boundary.
8. **No public API or interface changes.** Nothing that breaks a caller
   elsewhere in the codebase or downstream.
9. **Reversible as one commit.** A single `git revert` should undo the
   entire change cleanly.
10. **Existing tests cover the area.** Or a trivial extension of an
    existing test is enough. If you'd need to build new test scaffolding,
    the change is not fast-track.

### Gate failure

If any criterion fails, stop immediately and tell the human:

> This doesn't fit the fast-track gate because [specific criterion].
> Running `/spade-scope` for the full loop is the right call here.

Do not attempt to "partially" fast-track by skipping just one rule.
The gate is all-or-nothing.

## Classification

Every quick-path change gets a `type:*` label. Pick the closest match:

- **`type:bug`** — fixing incorrect behaviour
- **`type:tweak`** — small behaviour or UX adjustment that isn't strictly a bug
- **`type:chore`** — maintenance, version bumps (non-breaking), housekeeping
- **`type:docs`** — documentation, comments, README updates
- **`type:refactor`** — rename, extract, inline, or similar non-behavioural change

If the work sits between two types, pick the closer one and name the
runner-up in the PR description. If the gate check leaves "is this
trivial enough" genuinely open, that is a gate failure: fall back to
`/spade-scope` and record why. Neither case prompts the human.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify

- Read the bug report, ticket, or user description.
- Walk the gate criteria out loud. Confirm each one. If any fail, bail.
- Classify with a `type:*` label.
- If there's a Linear issue, note its ID. If not, decide: in `linear` or
  `hybrid` mode a behavioural change gets a Linear issue and a typo in a
  comment or docs needs only the PR; in `local` mode the PR is the audit
  artefact and no tracker call is made. Say which you chose.
- **Arm the guard.** Through `exec_command`, write `quick` to
  `.spade/guard/$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID/mode` before the first edit. On
  the Claude host the mechanical guard then denies any protected-path
  write for the rest of the run (`docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Mechanical
  guards). A deny is a halt: stop, show the guard's reason, and tell the
  human the change is not quick-eligible. Do not retry the write another
  way and do not carry the work into the full loop yourself; the human
  opens a Scope if they still want it. Remove the marker as the last step
  after the PR is opened or after the halt is reported.

### 2. Fix

- Create a quick-path branch: `spade-quick/<issue-id>-<slug>` (or
  `spade-quick/<slug>` if there's no Linear issue).
- Make the change in a **single commit**. If you find yourself wanting
  a second commit, that's a signal the work is bigger than fast-track
  allows — stop and re-evaluate the gate.
- Do not refactor nearby code "while you're there". That's out of scope.

### 3. Verify

- Run the existing test suite. It must pass.
- If the change is behavioural, extend an existing test or add one small
  assertion. If that would require new test scaffolding, you failed the
  gate — bail.
- If the change is visible (UI, output format, CLI help text), manually
  verify it in the relevant environment and record what you checked.

### 4. PR

- Open a pull request using the template below.
- Apply the `/unslop` pass to the PR title and the description's prose
  before opening it; leave the template's structured fields, commands,
  and checkbox syntax untouched.
- The PR description **is the audit artefact**. There is no separate
  Plan document, no sub-issue, no evaluation comment. The PR carries
  everything a future reader needs.
- On the Linear issue (if one exists): add the labels, post the PR URL
  as a comment, move the status to "In Review". Close it once the PR is
  merged with its checks green; until then it stays "In Review". The
  merged PR with its gate checklist is the audit artefact behind that close.
- Remove `.spade/guard/$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID/mode`.

*Delivered via `/spade-quick` — fast-track path for trivial changes.*
```

Every gate-check box must be ticked. If you can't tick one, you failed
the gate and should not have reached this step.

## Linear Integration

In `linear` or `hybrid` mode, when there's an issue:

1. Apply labels to the issue:
   - `spade:quick`
   - One of `type:bug`, `type:tweak`, `type:chore`, `type:docs`, `type:refactor`
   - `ai-delivered` or `human-delivery` (whichever applies)
2. Update status: Todo → In Progress → In Review.
3. Post the PR URL as a comment.
4. **Do NOT create sub-issues.** The parent issue is the whole unit of
   work on the quick path. Do not attach a Plan document. Do not generate
   an approval checklist comment.
5. **Close the issue once the PR is merged with its checks green.** The
   merged PR and its gate checklist are the audit artefact behind that
   close; without a merged PR the issue stays "In Review".

If there's no Linear issue (a pure-PR trivial fix), the PR itself is the
audit trail. The PR description must still follow the template above.

## When the Gate Changes Mid-Flight

If you're partway through delivering a fast-track change and discover
that the change is actually bigger than the gate allows (a "simple" bug
fix that now needs two files, or a "tiny" tweak that exposes a schema
issue), **stop immediately**:

1. Do not commit what you have.
2. Explain to the human what you found and which gate criterion now fails.
3. Recommend falling back to `/spade-scope` for a proper Scope + Plan.
4. If the human agrees, the in-progress work can be discarded or carried
   into a proper Scope — but not fast-tracked.

It is not a failure to bail out. It is the gate working correctly.

## What `/spade-quick` is NOT for

- Incident response (use the full loop, ceremony is cheap during an incident)
- First-pass work on a new feature, even a small one
- Anything touching ARCHITECTURE.md or PATTERNS.md
- Anything a human reviewer would want to discuss before it lands
- "Several small changes bundled together" — if there are several,
  write a Scope and use delivery bundles on the full loop

## Relationship to the Full Loop

`/spade-quick` exists because full-loop ceremony for trivial work is
wasteful. It is *not* a replacement for the full loop, and it is *not*
the default. The defaults remain:

- **Non-trivial work** → `/spade-scope` → `/spade-plan` → `/spade-approve`
  → deliver → `/spade-evaluate`
- **Trivial work meeting every gate criterion** → `/spade-quick`

When in doubt, use the full loop. The cost of full-loop ceremony on
work that could have been fast-track is a few minutes of friction. The
cost of fast-tracking work that should have had a Scope is a broken
audit trail and, eventually, a broken framework.
