# Anti-Patterns

Things this project does not do, with rationale. AI agents must read this file
before generating any Plan. If a proposed solution uses any of these patterns,
it must be flagged and an alternative approach proposed.

## Architectural Anti-Patterns

- **Do not introduce a runtime.** SPADE is Markdown + shell. Do not propose a
  Node / Python / Go service, a daemon, a background worker, or any long-lived
  process owned by this repo. Rationale: the value of the framework is that it
  is inspectable, forkable, and portable with zero build step.
- **Do not add a compiled build step.** No TypeScript, no Rust CLI, no Go
  binary. Rationale: every compile step adds an install failure mode for
  consumers and a maintenance burden for the framework.
- **Do not bind to a single agent platform in skill prose.** Skills should be
  readable by any agent runtime that supports Markdown skills. Claude Code is
  the primary target but skills must not encode Claude-specific assumptions.
- **Do not add a second external tracker integration speculatively.** Linear
  is the only one today. A second one (GitHub Issues, Jira) is a scope
  decision, not a pattern to pile on.
- **Do not centralise state outside the repo.** All per-project state lives in
  `.spade/`. Do not propose a remote config service or shared database.

## Code Anti-Patterns

- **Do not write scripts that duplicate skill prose.** If a skill already
  describes a behaviour in natural language, do not add a bash or node script
  that "enforces" it. The agent reads the prose.
  `bin/spade-guard` is the bounded exception: it checks a fixed list of
  invariants the harness can verify without judgement, defined once in
  `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Mechanical guards. Do not grow it into workflow logic.
- **Do not use GNU-only flags in `setup`.** `sed -i` without extension,
  `readlink -f`, `realpath`, non-POSIX `find` predicates. macOS bash 3.2 is
  the floor.
- **Do not let update checks exit non-zero on soft failures.**
  `spade-update-check` must never break an unrelated skill invocation.
  Explicit lifecycle diagnostics use non-zero drift and unsupported statuses by contract.
- **Do not skip PowerShell parity.** A change to `setup` without the matching
  `setup.ps1` change is incomplete and must be rejected at review.
- **Do not emit emojis in files, scripts, or skill output** unless the user
  explicitly asks. The framework writes to consumer repos; gratuitous emoji
  is noise.

## Security Anti-Patterns

- **Do not hard-code Linear tokens, API keys, or credentials anywhere.**
  Permissions come from the consumer project's `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- **Do not curl | bash.** `setup` operates only on local repo contents.
  `spade-update-check` fetches from the pinned remote and never executes
  anything it pulls.
- **Do not approve moving release references.** Branch names, local refs,
  cached version strings, and unverified tags cannot substitute for an exact
  commit fetched from the canonical remote and approved by the human.
- **Do not put executable commands in project configuration.** Handoff config
  may select an allowlisted agent, but the trusted launcher owns exact binaries,
  arguments, prompt transport, and autonomy flags.
- **Do not render untrusted Markdown as active HTML.** Raw HTML, unsafe links,
  fetchable images, template includes, and document-supplied attributes must not
  reach the local standalone document as active content.
- **Do not append blindly to consumer `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.** Use fragment
  markers so onboarding is idempotent — repeated runs must not duplicate
  content. Non-idempotent writes are a correctness bug with a security
  flavour: drift between the intended and actual state hides modifications.
- **Do not widen `.claude/settings.local.json` permissions by default.**
  Start minimal; require explicit opt-in for new MCP or Bash grants.

## Dependency Anti-Patterns

- **Do not add runtime dependencies.** There is no package manager here. A PR
  that introduces `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`
  is rejected on sight unless accompanied by an approved Plan that explicitly
  introduces a runtime.
- **Do not add dev-only tooling casually.** Each added tool (linter,
  formatter) is friction on first contribution. Only add when the value
  clearly outweighs the onboarding cost.
- **Do not depend on an MCP server beyond Linear** without explicit scope.
  The framework must remain usable in environments with only the base tools.

## Process Anti-Patterns

- **Do not write code without a Scope.** Exceptions go through `/spade-quick`,
  which has ten explicit gate criteria (see AGENTS.md).
- **Do not deliver without an approved Plan** on the full loop.
  Approval is a STOP gate with one sanctioned exception: the **Deliver autonomy level** (`/spade`) records a *machine-attributed* auto-approval of the Plan and continues to an open PR, project-native checks, the two-axis Delivery Review, and an agent-recorded Evaluate verdict when every criterion is machine-verifiable.
  Merge then follows `autonomy.deliver.merge` (see `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § "The Deliver level" and § Ship).
  Every other path keeps the pre-code STOP gate.
  If in doubt, ask.
- **Do not move a parent Scope issue to Done without a recorded PASS behind
  it.** Done is the audit-trail closure point, so it rests on the Evaluate
  record: a PARTIAL, a FAIL, or an open evidence row leaves the issue in
  Evaluating. Whoever recorded the PASS closes it.
- **Do not disarm or route around a mechanical guard.** A guard deny is a halt
  to surface to the human. Removing a marker, editing the guard or
  `.spade/config`, or reaching the same file through a shell command defeats
  the point. Only a human may disarm a guard, and the run trace records it.
- **Do not bundle unrelated changes into a single PR.** One Scope → one Plan →
  N bundles → N PRs. Each PR closes only its bundle's sub-issues.
- **Do not let fragment versions drift.** When a fragment changes, bump the
  marker version and update `/spade-update` so consumers can pull the new
  content safely.
- **Do not add skills casually.** Each new skill is surface area the user must
  learn. New skills require a Scope and must explain what existing skill they
  subsume or why they are genuinely orthogonal.
