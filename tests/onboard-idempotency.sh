# SPADE Framework — onboarding idempotency test
#
# Exercises bin/spade-marker-replace against the fixtures under
# tests/fixtures/ and asserts:
#
#   1. Running onboarding twice produces the same output on the second run
#      (no drift, no duplicated marker blocks).
#   2. A fixture with an old v1.0.0 block ends with exactly one block and
#      the current content, not the stale content.
#   3. A clean fixture gains exactly one block.
#   4. Mismatched / duplicate marker files are rejected without modification.
#
# Usage: tests/onboard-idempotency.sh
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
