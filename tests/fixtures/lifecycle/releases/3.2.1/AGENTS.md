# SPADE Framework — Agent Operating Rules

These rules define mandatory behaviour for AI agents using the SPADE framework
in this project. They augment any existing agent instructions in this file.

## The SPADE Loop

Every unit of work follows five phases:

    SCOPE → PLAN → APPROVE → DELIVER → EVALUATE

Humans own Scope and Evaluate. AI owns Plan and Deliver. Approve is a human gate.
You must never skip a phase or combine phases without explicit human instruction.

**Exception — the fast-track path.** Trivial work (a typo, a one-line tweak,
a config nudge) can use `/spade-quick` instead of the full loop. See the
"Fast-Track Path" section below for the gate criteria. When in doubt, use
the full loop.

**Entry point — the `/spade` orchestrator.** New work can start with `/spade`,
which presents an autonomy picker (Deliver / Plan / Scope / Stub) and drives
the loop from one locked Scope as far as the chosen level allows, halting on a
tripwire. It does not change the loop or remove any gate, and routes trivial
work to `/spade-quick`. See `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` § Autonomy Pipeline.

## Phase Rules

### 1. Scope (Human-Owned)
- Never begin planning or writing code without a written Scope.
- A Scope must include: statement of intent, acceptance criteria, and constraints.
- If asked to "just do X" without a Scope, help define one first.
- **Before scoping, check the fast-track gate.** If every criterion below
  passes, invoke `/spade-quick` instead of `/spade-scope`.

### 2. Plan (AI-Owned)
- Produce a structured Plan (3-7 tasks) before writing any code.
- Include: technical approach, dependencies, risks, delivery mode, testing strategy, delivery bundles, and per-task **execution posture**.
- Execution posture is one of `test-first`, `characterization-first`, `refactor-first`, `spike`, or `straight-through`. Every task must declare one — there is no silent default. See `docs/FRAMEWORK.md#execution-posture` for the vocabulary.
- Every task must declare a tracer-bullet outcome: the end-to-end behavior made usable, the highest practical test seam, and explicit blocking relationships.
- Default to vertical slices that produce observable behavior.
  An intentionally horizontal or preparatory task must explain why it stands alone and what vertical outcome it enables.
- Delivery bundles map tasks to pull requests. Default to one bundle (one PR)
  per Scope. Only split when tasks are genuinely independent and isolated
  review or revert provides real value.
- Document the Plan on the parent issue as a first-class artefact.
- Create sub-issues with labels: `ai-planned`, `ai-delivered` or `human-delivery`.
- Do NOT begin delivery until the Plan is approved by a human.

### 3. Approve (Human Gate)
- After producing a Plan, STOP and wait for human approval.
- If rejected, apply `plan-rejected` label, revise, and re-present.
- Do not begin delivery on a rejected or unapproved plan.
- **Deliver-level exception.** The Deliver autonomy level (`/spade`) records a machine-attributed auto-approval and continues to code and an open PR.
  It halts before merge unless a human completes Evaluate against the acceptance criteria, reviews the approach summary and diff, confirms all required repository checks have passed, then explicitly asks the agent to merge.
  Every other path keeps the pre-code STOP gate above.
- **Independent second opinion (optional).** The human may request `/spade-review` for an independent perspective before deciding.
  A triage step casts from eight canonical persona lanes plus evidence-driven ad-hoc personas, under drop-with-cause, then merges structured findings by convergence into a single report.
  Non-blocking, informational only - the review never gates approval or
  delivery.

### 4. Deliver (AI or Human)
- Execute the approved Plan one **delivery bundle** at a time. A bundle is
  one branch and one PR that closes every sub-issue assigned to it.
- Within a bundle, work through sub-issues in dependency order, committing
  as you go. Do not open a separate PR per sub-issue inside the same bundle.
- Run tests and verify before marking sub-issues complete.
- Record an immutable review base before changes and the final head after all changes and project-native checks.
- Review the exact fixed range on two independent axes: Scope and acceptance-criteria conformance, and repository engineering-standard conformance.
- A later commit makes head-bound review and command evidence stale and requires a fresh run.
- If delivery reveals the Plan is wrong, stop and explain before continuing.

### 5. Evaluate (Human-Owned)
- Never mark a parent issue as Done. Only humans do this.
- If asked to help evaluate, classify every criterion as diff-verifiable, runtime-verifiable, external-state, or human-only.
- Runtime-verifiable criteria require fresh commands and results.
  UI criteria require proportionate browser, screenshot, console, or network evidence.
  External-state and human-only criteria remain explicitly open until verified by the appropriate owner.
- Delivery Review findings and the evidence matrix support an agent recommendation of PASS, PARTIAL, or FAIL.
  The human owns the final verdict, Done, and Ship.
- After a human completes Evaluate against the acceptance criteria, reviews the approach summary and diff, and confirms all required repository checks have passed, an AI agent may merge the verified PR when explicitly asked.
  Human ownership of Evaluate still permits delegated operation of the merge control under these conditions.
- **Capture learnings.** After Evaluate — or anytime during delivery when the
  team notices something worth remembering for future work — suggest
  `/spade-learn` to record it under `.spade/learnings/`. `/spade-plan`
  surfaces matching learnings automatically on the next related Scope.

## Fast-Track Path (Small Work)

Not every change deserves a Scope. The fast-track path handles trivial work
— typo fixes, one-line tweaks, small config nudges, docs changes — through
`/spade-quick`. On this path, the **PR description is the audit artefact**:
no sub-issues, no separate Plan, no approval gate beyond PR review.

**When a human describes a small fix, tweak, config nudge, or docs change,
check the fast-track gate BEFORE invoking `/spade-scope`.** If every
criterion below passes, run `/spade-quick`. Only fall back to the full
loop if the gate fails.

### The Gate — ALL must be true

1. Single concern (one bug, one tweak, one touch-up)
2. ≤ 50 lines of code changed total; hard stop above ~100
3. One file, or a tight cluster in one module
4. No new dependencies (package.json / go.mod / pyproject / Cargo.toml untouched)
5. No schema, migration, or data-layer changes
6. No architectural changes, no new patterns, no new abstractions
7. No security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, secrets, permissions)
8. No public API or interface breaking changes
9. Reversible as one commit
10. Existing tests cover the area (trivial extension is fine; new test
    scaffolding is not)

If *any* criterion fails, stop and invoke `/spade-scope` for the full loop.
The gate is all-or-nothing — do not attempt to "partially" fast-track.

### Linear tracking on the fast-track

- Parent issue gets labels: `spade:quick`, one `type:*` label
  (`type:bug`, `type:tweak`, `type:chore`, `type:docs`, `type:refactor`),
  and `ai-delivered` or `human-delivery`.
- **No sub-issues are created.** The parent issue IS the work unit.
- The PR description is the audit trail. PR URL is posted as a comment on
  the parent issue. Human owns the Done transition, as always.

### Evaluating quick-path work

`/spade-evaluate` on a `spade:quick`-labelled issue validates the PR
directly (merged, CI green, checklist complete) instead of iterating
sub-issues. If evaluation is PARTIAL: fixes go as new commits on the
same branch if the PR hasn't merged, or as a new quick-path PR referencing
the original if it has. **Sub-issue creation is forbidden on the quick
path regardless of verdict.**

## Architecture Constraints

Before generating any Plan, read these files if they exist:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system architecture and constraints
- `PATTERNS.md` — approved patterns and conventions
- `ANTI-PATTERNS.md` — things you must not do

Flag any conflicts between proposed solutions and these documents.

## Linear Integration

When Linear MCP is available, use it to:
- Read Scopes from parent issues
- Create sub-issues for Plans with labels and priorities (full loop only)
- Update statuses: Scoped → Planning → Approval → Delivering → Evaluating → Done
- Attach Plan documents as comments on parent issues
- Apply `spade:quick` and `type:*` labels on fast-track items

## Audit Trail

Every piece of work must have: a human-written Scope, a documented Plan,
an Approval decision, delivery records with labels, and a human Evaluation.
Work that cannot be traced through this chain must not be delivered.

For fast-track work, the PR description carries the equivalent audit
trail — the gate checklist, the type classification, the verification
notes, and the link to Linear (if any). A quick-path PR without a filled
template is not a valid audit trail.

## What You Must Never Do

- Begin coding without a documented Scope (or a valid fast-track gate pass)
- Begin delivery without an approved Plan (on the full loop)
- Mark a parent issue as Done
- Skip documenting the Plan
- Misuse `/spade-quick` for work that fails any gate criterion
- Create sub-issues on the fast-track path
- Introduce technologies conflicting with ARCHITECTURE.md without flagging it
- Assume organisational context you do not have
